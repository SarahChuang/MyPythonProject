# MyPythonProject
My Python project includes many different assignments.
1. Python Photoshop: This program can eliminate pixels we don't want in multiple pictures and combine them into a new clean photo.
2. Baby names searching: This program can produce a diagram by years associated with the given baby name.
3. The breakout game: This program can control a panel to hit a bouncing ball to eliminate bricks.
4. The hangman game: This program plays the hangman game. Users see a dashed word and try to correctly figure the un-dashed word out by inputting one character each round.
